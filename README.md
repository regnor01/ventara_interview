This is a basic simulation of a card game tournament, where participants are randomly assigned what place (1-8) they are given for a game, and there are seven games processed per simulation. Currently, it uses the JOption pane as a GUI, and does support changing the number of simulations and players. 

KNOWN ISSUES: if the number of players is not divisible by eight, certain players will earn 0 points per round as they cannot participate in a game. The program will exit if a user inputs anything other than an integer, and does not let them retry unless they reopen the application.
